> **Built on** [chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite) by Seo Jong Hak

## Features

- **Task Capture**: Quickly capture tasks directly from any webpage
- **Focus Lock**: Block distracting websites during focus sessions
- **Dashboard**: Full-featured web dashboard for managing your productivity
- **Habit Tracking**: Track daily habits and routines
- **Goal Management**: Set and monitor your goals
- **Time Tracking**: Monitor focus sessions and productivity
- **Sync Storage**: Synchronized storage across all extension pages
- **Google Sign-In**: Authenticate via Google OAuth (`Dashboard/backend/auth.py`)
- **Google Calendar Sync** *(planned)*: two-way sync between the AI-generated time-blocked schedule and the user's Google Calendar — avoid conflicts when scheduling focus blocks, and surface planned blocks/deadlines on the user's calendar

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI
- **Extension**: Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- Python 3.10+
- Chrome or Chromium browser

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vibe2ship.git
cd vibe2ship
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables

   The root `.env` (extension build flags, no secrets) is created automatically
   by `pnpm install`. For the dashboard backend, copy the template and fill it in:
```bash
cp Dashboard/backend/.env.example Dashboard/backend/.env
```

4. Build the extension
```bash
pnpm build
```

### Development

1. Start the development build with HMR:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

2. Load the extension in Chrome:
   - Open `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `dist` folder

3. For the dashboard backend:
```bash
cd Dashboard/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

4. For the dashboard frontend:
```bash
cd Dashboard/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Sharing Without the Chrome Web Store

For reviewers/organizers who just want to try the extension without building from source:

1. Build and zip it: `pnpm zip` (outputs to `dist-zip/extension-<timestamp>.zip`)
2. Share that zip file (Drive, GitHub release, etc.)
3. Ask them to:
   - Unzip it
   - Open `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable **Developer mode**
   - Click **Load unpacked** and select the unzipped folder

## Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Start development mode with HMR
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm test` - Run tests

## Configuration

### Chrome Extension

- Manifest: `chrome-extension/manifest.ts`
- Background script: `chrome-extension/src/background/`
- Content scripts: `pages/content/`

### Environment Variables

See `Dashboard/backend/.env.example` for the backend variables and what each one does.

For Google Calendar sync (`Dashboard/backend/calendar_sync.py`), set in `Dashboard/backend/.env`:
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` — defaults to the same client id used for sign-in
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` — required; create a Web application OAuth client in Google Cloud Console with the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events` scope enabled
