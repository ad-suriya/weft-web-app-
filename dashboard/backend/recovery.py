"""Automatic task recovery.

When a task is missed — its scheduled block ended incomplete, the user
explicitly skips it, or they've gone idle on it — this recalculates what's
left (scheduler.remaining_minutes, which already nets out completed_minutes),
finds the nearest real free time, and greedily redistributes the work into
it. Anything that depends on the moved task (db.py's `dependencies`) gets
cascaded automatically, so "backend depends on frontend" means backend's
slot shifts the moment frontend's does.

Free-slot finding/chunking lives in scheduler.py (build_schedule's
dependency-aware engine uses the exact same functions) — this module only
adds the seed-task-plus-cascade traversal on top.
